Animals are a diverse group of living organisms that inhabit nearly every part of the Earth, 
from deep oceans to the highest mountains. They range in size from microscopic creatures like 
plankton to massive mammals like elephants and whales. Each species has evolved unique adaptations 
that help them survive and thrive in their environments. Some animals are herbivores, 
relying on plants for sustenance, while others are carnivores that hunt or scavenge for food. 
There are also omnivores, like bears and humans, that consume both plants and animals. 
Beyond their roles in ecosystems, animals are crucial for maintaining biodiversity 
and often hold significant cultural, spiritual, and economic importance for humans.
